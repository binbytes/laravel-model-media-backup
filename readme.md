Take newly added media backup associated with any model rather than full backup on daily basis.

This package will be useful in the case where you have lot of media/attachment with any models but rather than taking all media directories each day it might be better to just take newly added media.


BinBytes is an web & mobile application development agency in Rajkot, India. You'll find an overview of all our services [on our website](https://binbytes.com).

## Installation

You can install this package via composer using:

``` bash
$ composer require binbytes/laravel-model-media-backup
```

The package will automatically register itself.

To publish the config file to `config/modelmediabackup.php` run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BinBytes\ModelMediaBackup\ModelMediaBackupServiceProvider"
```
This will publish a file `modelmediabackup.php` in your config directory with the following contents:

```php
return [
    /*
         * Models from which you want to take media for backup
         */
        'Models' => [
            // Example 'App\User'
        ],
    
        /*
         * Backup FILESYSTEM_DRIVER name on which you want to take backup
         */
        'BACKUP_DISK' => null, // FILESYSTEM_DRIVER
    
        /*
         * Number of records to be chunk in backup process
         */
        'ChunkSize' => 100,

        /*
         * Notification configuration
         */
        'Notification' => [
    
            /*
             * Email address where you want to receive email alert
             */
            'MailTo' => null,
    
            /*
             * Here you can specify the notifiable to which the notifications should be sent. The default
             *
             * notifiable will use the variables specified in this config file.
             */
            'notifiable' => \BinBytes\ModelMediaBackup\Notifications\Notifiable::class,
    
            'Notifications' => [
                \BinBytes\ModelMediaBackup\Notifications\Notifications\MediaBackupSuccessful::class,
            ]
        ]
];
```
## Usage
After you've installed the package and filled in the values in the config-file, you need to setup model from which you want to take media.

Your Eloquent models should use the `BinBytes\ModelMediaBackup\Traits\HasBackupRecord` trait.

The trait contains an abstract method `backupFiles()` that you must implement yourself. 

Here's an example of how to implement the trait:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use BinBytes\ModelMediaBackup\Traits\HasBackupRecords;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class YourEloquentModel extends Model
{
    use HasBackupRecords;

    /**
     * Media file associated with record
     * @return string|array
     */
    public function backupFiles()
    {
        return $this->path(); // Full path of your media file OR array of paths
    }
}
```

Want to take records as per own strategy? according to your need? No problem!
By default the records of yesterday will be taken for backup.

```php
/**
 * Select records to processed
 */
public static function backupRecords()
{
    return self::latest()
            ->whereDate('created_at', Carbon::yesterday()->toDateString());
}
```

Now you are ready to go, just run below artisan command to take backup
```php
php artisan model:media:backup
```

To run backup on daily basis add this in `App\Console\Kernel`
```php
$schedule->command('model:media:backup')->daily();
```
